# Murphmon Ruleset by [BigMurph619](https://www.twitch.tv/bigmurph619):

This ruleset is inspired by the [Super Kaizo IronMON Ruleset](https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON) by [iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie)

## Rules

Settings: The game must be randomized. All opponents must be level buffed by 50%, all opponents must have Smart AI, all opponents must have usable items (FRLG Super Kaizo settings string). All move tutors, TMs, and items must be randomized.

1. You may pick any mon you want in the lab that is 555 BST or lower.

2. All items are legal in lab

3. Pivoting: Catch up to 3 total unique mons from any area (they can be all from one area, all different, or a combination), pick which one you want to run between those 3 and lab mon. Must pivot before the first trainer fight. If a mon receives Exp from a wild before first trainer, you are locked into that Mon and can no longer pivot. You may not swap in Mons while scouting/catching. You may use any Mon at the front of your party, however, until you lock in your pivot. You may not swap mons during encounters. 1 free favorite each. You may catch a second of the same favorite but it will count towards your 3 pivots. Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon).

4. "Brock Buddy": Get a second mon to fight with in Pewter Gym (first mon you see after Viridian Forest, no restrictions[Illegal abilities/BSTs allowed]. Catch the first encounter or bust). Brock Buddy may faint, primary Mon cannot. You may use Brockbuddy to lead fights, multiple swaps, or any way you see fit EXCEPT using illegal moves.

5. All hidden items are allowed - you may only obtain step items once.

6. All found and gifted TMs are allowed (No purchasing TMs) - all move tutors are allowed (i.e. mega punch/kick guys after mt. Moon). No HMs. No restrictions on Sketch. Sketch your whole moveset if you want. If you find a way to learn Sketch multiple times on a decent Mon, sketch your heart out...sounds fun. BUT, if you accidentally catch a mon while sketch scouting you must release it and not take its item.

7. You must beat Misty before “Dig” Rocket.

8. You must beat Lt. Surge before entering  Rock Tunnel.

9. SS Anne EXP and item farming is allowed (Treat this as a dungeon).

10. You must beat Erika before waking up Snorlax.

11. You must pivot to a new mon that you have not caught yet in the Safari Zone. You may catch up to 6 Safari Zone pivot options.
    - Banned ability mons don't count towards your catches UNLESS you want to keep its held item (This may only be done once. You may not farm multiple items off of the same illegal mon). -If you evolve an illegal mon into a legal one with a stone or rare candy that counts as 1 pivot still. You may not level up an illegal mon on trainers.
    - You may catch 1 free pivot of each of your favorites (additional catches count towards your 6 pivot catches).
    - All shinies are free catches
    - You may only level up each mon once before committing to a pivot.
    - You may only get 2 of same mon as option (Favorites/shinies/illegal mons do not count towards these 2)
    -You may create save states to retry catching encounters or “catch and stow” potential options before committing to them to save time. If you see any of the mon’s stats (including its HP within your party), it automatically counts as one of your catches.

12. You must beat Koga and the remainder of the game with your Safari Zone pivot.

13. You must beat Sabrina before entering the Pokemon Mansion.

14. Sevii islands are treated as "overworld". All items allowed, all exp allowed, etc. You may return to Sevii islands at any point. You may use a second HM friend for Rock Smash as needed.

15. Double battles: you may use any legal second mon you have already caught. You may attack freely with the second mon and it may hold legal held items. You may only have 2 Pokemon in your party.

16. All held items found on pivot options, Brockbuddies, HM friend catches are allowed to be kept. "Catch and release" mon held items are not allowed. Purchased/gifted mon's items are not allowed i.e. Magikarp Route 4, Silph Co. Lapras, Dojo Hitmon. You may not catch a wild mon unless it is a pivot option, Brockbuddy, Shiny or needed for HM friend.
